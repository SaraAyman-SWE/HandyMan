# Sallahly Web App

## Project Objective
This project aims towards helping people easily find trusted handymen whenever they need them, especially since it is now very difficult to
Find a professional one. Sallahly is a handyman web app where the client can select a certain level of craftsmanship and get trusted (top-rated) handymen workers to choose from.
The client should select one and make a request with an appropriate time as each handyman has a different schedule, then wait for a maximum of 30 minutes till the handyman responds.
Otherwise, the request will be canceled.

## System Benefits 
 
* ### Easy to Book & Quick Payments
The app allows the user to choose from the available crafts, then select a handyman and set a service time. The app also allows the user to see each handyman's fixed rate in advance,Â 
which means that the user will have an idea of what he will pay before requesting this service.

* ### Safety
The handyman's registration includes his SSN, criminal record, and ID photo. Admins review each handyman's documents and determine if they're verified or not. 
If the handyman doesn't add his criminal record and ID photo, he would be registered but not verified, so he can't be active or seen by clients. 
The user will be able to see an image of the handyman, compliments, facts, reviews, and all information about him.

 
* ### Rating System
The integrated rating system in the app will enable the user to rate the handyman after the service is finished.
This valuable feedback helps to find the bottleneck and fix the issue to enhance the system's overall business productivity.
